This repository contains my first HTML project, demonstrating essential HTML features and functionalities. The project includes the following components:

Form Creation: An interactive form for user input.

Image Insertion: Integrating images seamlessly into web pages.

Navigation: Linking multiple pages together for easy navigation.

Lists: Organizing content using ordered and unordered lists.

Login Page: A basic login interface for user authentication.

Each file showcases different aspects of HTML, providing a foundational understanding of web development.
